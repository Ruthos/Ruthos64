# Ruthos 0.1.0-alpha

The first public build of Ruthos, a Horos-inspired DICOM viewer and patient archive for Windows, written in Rust. It is an alpha: it works end to end on real studies, and it is rough in places. It is not for diagnostic use.

## What works

- **Archive.** Import folders, files or drag-and-drop; a DICOM listener (C-STORE SCP, AE title RUTHOS, port 11112) that files what modalities send; a Horos-style database window with albums, smart albums, the built-in Horos albums, search and filters, series thumbnails and a preview pane.
- **Codecs.** Uncompressed, RLE, deflate, JPEG baseline and 12-bit, JPEG lossless, JPEG-LS and JPEG 2000. Files without a meta header are accepted.
- **Viewer.** GPU window/level and the Horos colour lookup tables, zoom, pan, rotate, flip, cine at the file's frame rate, tiling of a series or of a study, per-cell lock, Horos corner annotations, key images, export to PNG and JPEG.
- **Measurements.** Length, angle, rectangle, oval, arrow, point and an LV M-mode tool with fractional shortening. Every value states its scale basis (ultrasound region, calibrated pixel spacing, patient plane, estimated magnification, detector plane, hand calibration or uncalibrated) and the report flags values that are not at the patient's scale. Handles on every measurement with keyboard nudging and undo, a GPU loupe while placing points, a Measurements menu, and a library of definitions, sets and calculations (Teichholz, LA/Ao, VHS and more) that is edited in Preferences and shared as JSON.
- **Reports.** A report per study with the named measurements, the LV M-mode block, calculations, findings and conclusion, exported to PDF with the key images.
- **Anonymisation for teaching.** Teaching copies built by allowlist with derived UIDs, shifted dates, pixel masking of ultrasound regions or saved templates with review, a named teaching case register, a sidecar that carries measurements, and an independent verification pass before anything is written.
- **Pictures.** Import JPEG or PNG photographs as DICOM with a patient form; grayscale radiograph exports become monochrome so they window.
- **Preferences** window, and error containment: a fault in one window closes that window and writes `crash.log` instead of closing the program.

## Not yet

- DICOM send and query/retrieve.
- Importing an existing Horos database.
- Anything 3D.
- A signed installer. This build is an unsigned zip: Windows SmartScreen will warn on first run, and a PC with Smart App Control in enforce mode will refuse it. Building from source avoids both.

## Running

Unzip anywhere and run `ruthos.exe`. The archive and logs live in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ruthos\Ruthos Data`, settings in `%APPDATA%\Ruthos\settings.json`. Point a modality at this computer's address, AE title RUTHOS, port 11112, and allow Ruthos through Windows Firewall when asked.

The archive format may change before 1.0. Keep your original files.

## Reporting problems

A file that does not import or display correctly is the most useful report you can make. Open an issue with the "file does not import" template and attach `ruthos.log` from the data folder.
